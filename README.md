Game Show App - Phrase Hunter

<p> This is a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."  where the player will be able to select a random, hidden phrase, and tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Game Rules:</h2>

<p>Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the game board displays the chosen letters on the screen.</p>

<p>A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).</p>

<p>If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen appears.</p>

<p>A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.</p>
